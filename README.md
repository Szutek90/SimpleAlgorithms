This project was created during my early days of learning programming. It focuses on basic concepts and fundamental principles of software development, using Java as the primary language. The code and examples here are intended to showcase my understanding of core programming techniques and practices at the beginner level.

The project includes basic algorithms for numbers, geometric figures, cryptography, sorting algorithms, validators, and a data generator.

## Algorithms Used
### Numbers: 
* Representation of numbers in any positional system,
* Checking if a number is prime,
* Checking if a number is a perfect number
* Factoring a number into prime factors,
* Iterative and recursive implementation of Euclid's algorithm,
* Iterative and recursive calculation of Fibonacci number values,
* Giving change greedily
* Calculating the value of the square root
* Calculating the value of a polynomial using the Horner scheme,
* Applications of Homer's scheme: representation of numbers in various number systems, quick raising to a power,
* Determining the zeros of functions using the halving method,
* Calculating the area of enclosed areas using the trapezoidal and rectangular method

### Searching and sorting:
* Finding the largest and smallest element in a set: naive and optimal algorithm,
* Sorting: bubble, by selection, by linear or binary insertion, by merging, fast, bucket,

### Text:
* Checking whether a given string of characters forms a palindrome or anagram,
* Alphabetical ordering (lexicographic)
* Searching for a pattern in the text,
* Calculating the value of an expression given in reverse Polish notation,

### Compression and encryption:
* Variable length character codes, e.g. Morse code, Huffman code,
* Caesar cipher,
* Rearrangement cipher,
* Public key cipher (RSA)

### Geometry:
* Checking the triangle condition,
* Examining the position of points relative to a straight line,
* Testing the affiliation of a point to a section,
* Intersection of sections,
* Belonging of a point to an area,

## Technologies and libraries used

* Java
* Maven
* Lombok
* JUnit
* AssertJ
